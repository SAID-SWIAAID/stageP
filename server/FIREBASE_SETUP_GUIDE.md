# 🔥 Firebase Setup Guide for supplier-bbb9c

## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUE
Your data is not being saved to Firebase because the server needs a service account key to connect to your Firebase project.

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION

### Step 1: Get Firebase Service Account Key

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project: `supplier-bbb9c`

2. **Navigate to Service Accounts:**
   - Click the gear icon ⚙️ (Project Settings) in the top left
   - Go to "Service accounts" tab
   - Click "Generate new private key" button
   - Click "Generate key" in the popup
   - Download the JSON file

3. **Replace the placeholder file:**
   - Open the downloaded JSON file
   - Copy ALL the content
   - Replace everything in `server/firebase-service-account.json`

### Step 2: Enable Firestore Database

1. **In Firebase Console:**
   - Go to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
   - Select a location (choose the closest to you)

2. **Verify Firestore is enabled:**
   - You should see "Cloud Firestore" in the left sidebar
   - The database should show as "Active"

### Step 3: Test the Connection

1. **Restart your server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Check server logs:**
   - You should see: "✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully."
   - You should see: "✅ Firestore connection test successful!"
   - NOT: "⚠️ Using in-memory storage for development."

### Step 4: Test User Registration

1. **Try registering a new user** or completing your profile
2. **Check Firebase Console** → Firestore Database to see if user data appears
3. **Try adding a product** and check if it appears in the database

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If you still see "Falling back to in-memory storage":
1. Check that your service account JSON is valid
2. Verify the project ID matches: `supplier-bbb9c`
3. Make sure you copied the entire JSON content

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Verify your service account has the correct permissions
2. Check that Firestore is enabled in your Firebase project
3. Ensure your project ID is correct

### If products still don't save:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the server is running on port 3001
3. Check that all required fields are filled in the form

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

- **Never commit your service account key to git**
- **Keep your private key secure**
- **Use environment variables in production**

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULT

After following these steps:
- ✅ Data will be saved to real Firestore
- ✅ Data will persist between server restarts
- ✅ You can view data in Firebase Console
- ✅ All CRUD operations will work with real database
- ✅ User profiles will be saved
